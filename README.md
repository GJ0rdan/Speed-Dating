## Speed Dating Project
This project explores the dynamics of romantic attraction using data from a speed dating experiment. The main goal is to analyze which attributes are most correlated with participants’ satisfaction — a key factor in determining whether someone was likely to want a second date.

## Objectives
Analyze the speed dating dataset to uncover patterns in dating preferences

Test hypotheses about what leads to satisfaction during a speed date

Use machine learning models to identify which features matter most

## Methods Used
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (e.g. handling missing values)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Random Forest Regressor for feature importance

Neural Network (Keras) to model satisfaction scores

## Initial Hypothesis
We predicted that fun would be the leading factor in determining satisfaction, assuming that people who enjoy themselves more would be more likely to seek a second date.

## Key Findings
contradictory to the initial hypothesis, physical attractiveness was the strongest predictor of satisfaction.

While "fun" and "shared interests" were moderately correlated with satisfaction, appearance consistently ranked highest across multiple models.

Random Forest feature importances and Neural Network performance both supported this result.
